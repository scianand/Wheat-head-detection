This repository includes the detection results on the Wheat dataset. It is the part of Kaggle Competition in which we have to detect wheat-heads using object detection algorithm.
I have use YOLOv3-tiny model to detect the wheat-heads. AlexeyAB Darknet Deep Learning Framework has been used to complete this task.
